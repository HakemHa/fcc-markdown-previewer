# FCC Project: Markdown Previewer

This is my solution to the markdown previewer project from FreeCodeCamp.

TODO:

1 - Adjustable width/height (add middle element as helper)

2 - Two layouts mode (vertical and horizontal)

3 - Smooth transitions

4 - Skip to changes

5 - Custom scrollbar

6 - Save button
